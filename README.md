### Project Overview

Peak Fitness is a simple e-commerce website designed with HTML, CSS and Javascript. It simulates an online store that promotes accessible & high quality fitness equipment to encourage persons to be healthier and more active. It is fully functional and includes basic functions such as registration and validated login, invoice generation and a shopping cart.

## Running the Website

1. Ensure all the files are within the same folder.
2. Open `Peak.html` in any browser.
3. You may sign in using default credentials:<br>
*Username:* admin<br>		
*Passwowrd:* admin123
<!-- 4. Or register by filling out the fields with a password 6 characters or longer. //non-functionality, leaving this part out for now -->
4. Upon a successful login, you will be redirected to the products page <!-- where you may add or remove items-->
<br><br>


<h3>Key Functionality</h3> <!-- I may take this part out entirely, but the 'running the website' part seemed too short; but does it really matter a whole lot -->
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Validation</strong> - Validation can be tested in the login forms and in checkout.</li>
  <li><strong>Invoice Generation</strong> - Upon checkout, an invoice can be printed with the details of your order.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Other Tools</h4>
